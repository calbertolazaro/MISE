## Abstract

The evolution of the DW / BI environment through successive delivery of decision-making applications gives rise to the recurring need to understand the data, flows, and people that are accountable for them. Much of the information that is generated when creating these applications is either inaccessible or fragmented, hampering the action time of those involved, such as analysts who need to understand the data they see or the technicians who develop data integration processes. This research
attempted to understand the tasks and interests of users interacting in a typical information-consuming environment that could benefit from the existence of a metadata repository. A possible approach to the implementation of a metadata architecture is demonstrated by describing a set of architectural concerns associated with the development of a tool that enables users to be more efficient in performing their tasks. The ADD method is used to design the architecture.
